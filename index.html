<h3> You can always count on me when you need chicken eggs or a place to crash. </h3>

In a group I can help when inspiration is needed, trying to bring together different ideas, and think pragmatically. In other words, trying to keep our feet on the ground but our head in the air.

<h3> A funny story </h3>

While arrested by the police in Germany for tresspassing in a coal mine, my fingers were too cold for the finger print scanner to work. So the fingerprint controlling lady cop had to try and warm my fingers with her hands. It was a very romantic moment and I was released without identification, I suppose due to the overwhelming awkwardness.

<summary>Secret bonus story</summary>
 A friend of mine was dogsitting for a rich friendly family on holiday. Every day she would go to their house, walk the dog, feed it and play with it. One day she sadly found the dog had died. She was afraid to tell the family but she was responsible for it and it was very hot out so she had to call them. They were sad but told her she should bring the dead dog to their parents, an old couple who lived in another town. So she came back with the biggest suitcase she could find, stuffed the dog in there (it was difficult because it was a big dog) and walked it to the train station. She was really exhausted when she arrived at the train platform and a man offered her to help carry the suitcase into the train. He asked what she was carrying that could be so heavy. She quickly had to come up with a less disturbing story so she said it was a music mixing table. She left the suitcase in between two carriages and sat down. Two stations down the tracks, just before the doors closed, she saw through the window that the man thiefishly jumped off the train with the suitcase.</p>
